Operating Platforms


    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

    The client for this project was The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room is a company that has a popular Android mobile game called Draw It or Lose It, which was inspired by the game show Win, Lose, or Draw. They wanted to expand their audience for their game by creating a web-based application that is accessible across different devices
    and browsers. 
    
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

    While developing this documentation, I believe that was I thorough in analyzing and breaking down each component of the game and each requirement that the client asked for. This includes things such as: cross-platform compatibility, various security needs, and more. By ensuring that my documentation was detailed,
    I provided comprehensive recommendations for each component of the application while ensuring that the requirements and design constraints were met. 
    
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

    Working through the design document clarified the software’s architecture and purpose, providing a well-structured roadmap before coding. It made it easier to outline classes, data handling, and communication processes, ensuring alignment with the client’s needs. Detailing each component helped solidify how parts 
    of the application would interact, such as the role of the GameService class in managing games and maintaining unique instances. This was especially valuable in implementing design patterns like Singleton and ensuring the system adhered to unique naming and identifier requirements.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    I would personally revise my table that I used for breaking down the differences between each operating platform. I think I would instead use something like a list format, rather than table, as the formatting for the table can be somewhat clunky and hard to read. Text blocks can become disjointed and
    overall look sloppy when compared to using a list.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on requirements like multi-platform support, unique identifiers, and security.  Understanding the user's needs helps ensure the software will be practical, efficient, and intuitive. A design that doesn’t reflect user needs can lead to poor usability, performance issues, 
    and a disconnect between the final product and what the client had envisoned. 
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

    When designing this software, I relied on my UML diagram to help guide my logic and thought processes as I was developing the code. This made it easier for me to work through the logic, as I felt having that visual representation of how the code should function helped guide my work as I developed the code
    for the software.
